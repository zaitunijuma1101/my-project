        <p style="display: block; color:darkblue;">Join us for an ultimate snorkel experience at Mnemba Atoll! Swim in the turquoise waters and surround yourself with tropical fish from the Indian Ocean. During your snorkel trip we visit two different snorkel sites at Mnemba Atoll. An experienced snorkeling guide will be showing you all the beautiful fish and marine life that can be found in the reefs of Zanzibar. You might even get the chance to swim with the bottlenose dolphins! (80% chance). For many, swimming with dolphins is a true once in a lifetime experience! The bottlenose dolphins are residents at Mnemba and we meet them on an almost daily basis! As we respect the underwater world and the dolphins, we have a strict "no touching" and "no chasing" policy. Looking for a unique full-day snorkeling experience?</p>
